This project presents a Verilog-based 4-way smart traffic light controller, implemented using a Finite State Machine (FSM) approach and developed in the Xilinx Vivado environment. The system is designed to manage traffic efficiently at a four-road intersection by controlling 12 LEDs (Red, Yellow, and Green for each road) in a time-sequenced manner. Each state in the FSM represents a specific combination of traffic light signals for safe and orderly vehicle movement. The controller cycles through eight defined states (S0 to S7) under normal operation, assigning green signals to one road at a time while others remain red or yellow during transitions. Additionally, a ninth state (S8) introduces an "All Green" mode, allowing all roads to have green lights simultaneouslyâ€”this is manually activated for low-traffic conditions or emergency situations where free movement from all directions is needed. The system features a 4-bit manual mode input, enabling real-time overrides that prioritize a specific road or activate the all-green state. This functionality mimics traffic police intervention or future smart city integrations using IoT. When no manual input is given, the FSM continues its default round-robin sequencing. The design has been verified using a comprehensive testbench, ensuring that all state transitions and manual overrides behave as expected. Such a model can be extended to real-world applications including urban junction control, emergency vehicle prioritization, and integration into wireless override systems via embedded platforms like ESP32. Future improvements may include dynamic green timing based on vehicle count, pedestrian crossing integration, and wireless/manual override via remote dashboards. This FSM-based traffic light controller serves as a foundational step toward more intelligent and responsive urban traffic management systems.
